## What have I done?
For this progress report I took your advice and did a bit of research on the canvas api for javascript and discovered it was extremely more straight forward than messing with divs
and doing css animations.

## Research
I did a lot of research and got a lot of good information from this bit of documentation from mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_animations
On top of that I discovered a guide by traversy media that I used to create a tiny gamified website with canvas.

I had a lot of fun for this progress report and I feel like I am making pretty good progress on getting and piecing together bits of knowledge to make a decent game pwa.
